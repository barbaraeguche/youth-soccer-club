		        Get a report of all active club members who have never lost a game in which they played in. A club member is considered to win a game if she/he has been
		        assigned to a game session and was assigned to the team that has a score higher than the score of the other team. The club member must be assigned to at
		        least one formation game session. The list should include the club memberâ€™s membership number, first name, last name, age, phone number, email and current
		        location name. The results should be displayed sorted in ascending order by location name then by club membership number.
