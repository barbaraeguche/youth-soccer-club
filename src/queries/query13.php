		        Get a report of all active club members who have only been assigned as goalkeepers in all the formation team sessions they have been assigned to.

		        from goalkeeper. The list should include the club memberâ€™s membership number, first name, last name, age, phone number, email and current location name. The results
		        should be displayed sorted in ascending order by location name then by club membership number.
